  - In singleton design pattern -> hm only ek hi baar object create karte hai aur pure project me kahi bhi use kr sakete hai
  - A Singleton class ensures only one instance exists  in the JVM
  --->  How to make singleton
   1. private static instance
   2. private constructor
   3. public method to return instance

             -- Way of breaking the singleton  design pattern
               1. Reflection API to break singleton pattern
               Solution -> i. If Object is there ==> thrown Exception (intside constructon)
                           ii. OR use ENUM
                2. Deserialization :
                solution -> implement readResolve() method

                3. Cloning (if we clone the object than also singleton pattern will be disrepute)

-constructor
    - kb bhi singleton design pattern use kr rhe ho to constructor hamesa private hi banana hai

    Lazy (Lazy initialization )way of creating single object
        Isme hm thread ke dhyan hi nhi diya hai
        If multiple thread is code ko execute kr rhe hai to problem hoga (kyuki threads are concurrent (means all thread execute at same time))
        To create this thread safe use "synchronized" keyword
         We have to synchronized only this otherwise if we synchronized full method then it will take time for executing other thread beacuse may be other code of this method are executing



   Eager(Eager Initialization) way if creating singleton
   Eager way me static variable sabse pahale initialize ho jate hai
